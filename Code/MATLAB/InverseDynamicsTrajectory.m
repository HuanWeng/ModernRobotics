% Takes thetamat: An N x n matrix of robot joint variables,
%       dthetamat: An N x n matrix of robot joint velocities,
%       ddthetamat: An N x n matrix of robot joint accelerations,
%       g: Gravity vector g,
%       Ftipmat: An N x 6 matrix of spatial forces applied by the 
%                end-effector (If there are no tip forces, the user should
%                input a zero and a zero matrix will be used),
%       Mlist: List of link frames i relative to i-1 at the home position,
%       Glist: Spatial inertia matrices Gi of the links,
%       Slist: Screw axes Si of the joints in a space frame.
% Returns taumat: The N x n matrix of joint forces/torques for the 
%                 specified trajectory, where each of the N rows is the 
%                 vector of joint forces/torques at each time step.
% This function uses InverseDynamics to calculate the joint forces/torques 
% required to move the serial chain along the given trajectory.
