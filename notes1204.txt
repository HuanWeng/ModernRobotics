Magnitude in all of them seems unnecessary.
Nearzero: Added to all of them as a basic helper function
array problem begin at AxisAng3
Rewrite all the log and exp.
Check the variable names which should match with those in roblib.pdf file
input of blist or thetalist in nb. use transpose

Not quite sure about ScrewToAxis.

Matlab:
Delete Magnitude and replace it by norm()


Mathematica:
Sometimes no need to add return


Python:
All notes marked as #?
Seems all coloumn vector outputs show as row vector but they really are coloumn

For algorithm:
Change the inputs/outputs of MatrixLog and MatrixExp (4 functions totally).
Change the Jacobian of both Body and Space from using loop in loop to using only one loop.


Note:
The introductions including the examples of all Log and Exp should be changed.

Book typos:
P114: MatrixLog6(T) misses 6
P106: Algorithm descriptions differ in (b) and (c)



How to change lines: 
Matlab:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...,


What if output is nearzero? right now it is ignored without any explanation

Python: (xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)           XXXXXXXXXXX\
