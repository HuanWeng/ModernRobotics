function M = MassMatrix(thetalist,Mlist,Glist,Slist)
% Takes thetalist: A list of joint variables,
% Mlist: List of link frames i relative to i-1 at the home position,
% Glist: Spatial inertia matrices Gi of the links,
% Slist: Screw axes Si of the joints in a space frame.
%
% Returns M: The numerical inertia matrix M(thetalist) of an n-joint serial chain at the
% given configuration thetalist.
% This function calls InverseDynamics n times, each time passing a ddthetalist vector
% with a single element equal to one and all other inputs set to zero. 
% Each call of InverseDynamics generates a single column,
% and these columns are assembled to create the inertia matrix.
