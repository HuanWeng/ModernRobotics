1Magnitude in all of them seems unnecessary.                                                      
1Nearzero: Added to all of them as a basic helper function                                        
1array problem begin at AxisAng3
1Rewrite all the log and exp.
1Check the variable names which should match with those in roblib.pdf file
1The dimension of thetamat is confusing in the textbook.
1Skip the last two functions of ch8.
1The last chapter left.
?ForwardDynamicsTrajectory: The last taulist not used. dt useless?
1ForwardDynamicsTrajectory proves to be true.
1InverseDynamicsTrajectory uses functions from ch9 to make inputs of example. others: ch11:  explanations needed to help to input

0Not quite sure about ScrewToAxis.
check on the name of the function

Matlab:
1Delete Magnitude and replace it by norm()
1"100" left in simulatecontrol 

Mathematica:
1Sometimes no need to add return
1input of blist or thetalist in nb. use transpose
1Round[] for the integration number

Python:
1All notes marked as #?
1Seems all coloumn vector outputs show as row vector but they really are coloumn
1The sign usage in ComputeTorque in ch11

For algorithm:
1Change the inputs/outputs of MatrixLog and MatrixExp (4 functions totally).
1Change the Jacobian of both Body and Space from using loop in loop to using only one loop.


Note:
1The introductions including the examples of all Log and Exp should be changed.
1The ex about inverseDynamics should be checked. Not changed yet.

Book typos:
1P114: MatrixLog6(T) misses 6
1P106: Algorithm descriptions differ in (b) and (c)
1P293: The definition of the variables in inverse dynamics, row or column?


How to change lines: 
Matlab:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...,


What if output is nearzero? right now it is ignored without any explanation


Python: (xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)           XXXXXXXXXXX\


how to represent the variables: col or row, 2D matrix
1Check with an example with just force, no dynamics,
