Magnitude in all of them seems unnecessary.
Nearzero: Added to all of them as a basic helper function
array problem begin at AxisAng3
Rewrite all the log and exp.
Check the variable names which should match with those in roblib.pdf file
The dimension of thetamat is confusing in the textbook.
Skip the last two functions of ch8.
The last chapter left.
ForwardDynamicsTrajectory: The last taulist not used. dt useless?
ForwardDynamicsTrajectory proves to be true.
InverseDynamicsTrajectory uses functions from ch9 to make inputs of example. others: ch11

Not quite sure about ScrewToAxis.

Matlab:
Delete Magnitude and replace it by norm()
"100" left in simulatecontrol 

Mathematica:
Sometimes no need to add return
input of blist or thetalist in nb. use transpose
Round[] for the integration number

Python:
All notes marked as #?
Seems all coloumn vector outputs show as row vector but they really are coloumn
The sign usage in ComputeTorque in ch11

For algorithm:
Change the inputs/outputs of MatrixLog and MatrixExp (4 functions totally).
Change the Jacobian of both Body and Space from using loop in loop to using only one loop.


Note:
The introductions including the examples of all Log and Exp should be changed.
The ex about inverseDynamics should be checked. Not changed yet.

Book typos:
P114: MatrixLog6(T) misses 6
P106: Algorithm descriptions differ in (b) and (c)
P293: The definition of the variables in inverse dynamics, row or column?


How to change lines: 
Matlab:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...,


What if output is nearzero? right now it is ignored without any explanation

Python: (xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)           XXXXXXXXXXX\
