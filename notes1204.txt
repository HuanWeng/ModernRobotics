Magnitude in all of them seems unnecessary.
Nearzero: Added to all of them as a basic helper function
array problem begin at AxisAng3
Rewrite all the log and exp.

Not quite sure about ScrewToAxis.

Matlab:
Delete Magnitude and replace it by norm()


Mathematica:
Sometimes no need to add return


Python:
All notes marked as #?


Note:
The introductions including the examples of all Log and Exp should be changed.

Book typos:
P114: MatrixLog6(T) misses 6
P106: Algorithm descriptions differ in (b) and (c)



How to change lines: 
Matlab:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...,


What if output is nearzero? right now it is ignored without any explanation

Python: (xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)           XXXXXXXXXXX\
