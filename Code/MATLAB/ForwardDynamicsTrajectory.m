function [thetamat,dthetamat] = ForwardDynamicsTrajectory(thetalist,dthetalist,taumat,g,Ftipmat,Mlist,Glist,Slist,dt, intRes)
% Takes thetalist: n-vector of initial joint variables.
% dthetalist: n-vector of initial joint rates.
% taumat: An N x n matrix of joint forces/torques, where each row is the joint effort at any time step,
% g: Gravity vector g,
% Ftipmat: An N x 6 matrix of spatial forces applied by the end-effector (If there are no tip
% forces, the user should input a zero and a zero matrix will be used),
% Mlist: List of link frames {i} relative to {i-1} at the home position,
% Glist: Spatial inertia matrices Gi of the links,
% Slist: Screw axes Si of the joints in a space frame,
% dt: The timestep between consecutive joint forces/torques.
% intRes: Integration resolution is the number of times integration (Euler) takes places
% between each time step. Must be an integer value greater than or equal to 1
%
% Returns thetamat: The N x n matrix of robot joint angles resulting from the 
% specified joint forces/torques,
% dthetamat: The N x n matrix of robot joint velocities.
% This function simulates the motion of a serial chain given an open-loop history 
% of joint forces/torques.
% It calls a numerical integration procedure that uses ForwardDynamics.
% Example Inputs (3 Link Robot):
