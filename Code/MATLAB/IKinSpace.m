function [thetalist,success] = IKinSpace(Slist,M,T,thetalist0,eomg,ev)
% Takes Slist: The joint screw axes in the space frame
% when the manipulator is at the home position.
% M: The home configuration of the end-effector.
% T: The desired end-effector configuration Tsd
% thetalist0: An initial guess of joint angles that are close to satisfying Tsd
% eomg: A small positive tolerance on the end-effector orientation error. The returned joint angles
% must give an end-effector orientation error less than eomg.
% ev: A small positive tolerance on the end-effector linear position error. The returned joint
% angles must give an end-effector position error less than ev.
%
% The maximum number of iterations before the algorithm is terminated has been hardcoded in
% as a variable called maxiterations. It is set to 20 at the start of the function, but can be changed if needed.  
%
% Returns thetalist: Joint angles that achieve T within the specified tolerances,
% success: A logical value where TRUE means that the function found a solution and FALSE
% means that it ran through the set number of maximum iterations without finding a solution
% within the tolerances eomg and ev.
% Uses an iterative Newton-Raphson root-finding method
