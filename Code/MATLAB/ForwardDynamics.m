function ddthetalist = ForwardDynamics(thetalist,dthetalist,taulist,g,Ftip,Mlist,Glist,Slist)
% Takes thetalist: A list of joint variables,
% dthetalist: A list of joint rates,
% taulist: An n-vector of joint forces/torques,
% g: Gravity vector g,
% Ftip: Spatial force applied by the end-effector expressed in frame {n+1},
% Mlist: List of link frames i relative to i-1 at the home position,
% Glist: Spatial inertia matrices Gi of the links,
% Slist: Screw axes Si of the joints in a space frame.
% 
% Returns ddthetalist: The resulting joint accelerations.
% This function computes ddthetalist by solving:
% Mlist(thetalist)ddthetalist = taulist - c(thetalist,dthetalist) - g(thetalist) - Jtr(thetalist)Ftip
