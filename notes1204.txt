Magnitude in all of them seems unnecessary.
Nearzero: Added to all of them as a basic helper function
array problem begin at AxisAng3
Exp: Not sure about if it is necessary to test theta=0, since the algorithm changes. Right now it does not test.
Rewrite all the log and exp.

Matlab:
Delete Magnitude and replace it by norm()

Python:
All notes marked as #?


Note:
The introductions including the examples of all Log and Exp should be changed.

Book typos:
P114: MatrixLog6(T) misses 6
