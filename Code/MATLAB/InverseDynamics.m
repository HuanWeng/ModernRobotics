function taulist = InverseDynamics(thetalist,dthetalist,ddthetalist,g,Ftip,Mlist,Glist,Slist)
% Takes thetalist: n-vector of joint variables,
% dthetalist: n-vector of joint rates,
% ddthetalist: n-vector of joint accelerations,
% g: Gravity vector g,
% Ftip: Spatial force applied by the end-effector expressed in frame {n+1},
% Mlist: List of link frames {i} relative to {i-1} at the home position,
% Glist: Spatial inertia matrices Gi of the links,
% Slist: Screw axes Si of the joints in a space frame.
%
% Returns taulist: The n-vector of required joint forces/torques.
% This function uses forward-backward Newton-Euler iterations to solve the equation:
% taulist = Mlist(thetalist)ddthetalist + c(thetalist,dthetalist) + g(thetalist) + Jtr(thetalist)Ftip
